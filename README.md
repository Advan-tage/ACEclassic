**ClassicACE is an Asheron's Call Emulator based on ACEmulator. It adds rulesets which change the gameplay rules:**
- Infiltration Ruleset: This replicates the Infiltration event which was released by Turbine in February 2005.
- CustomDM Ruleset: A variation of the Infiltration ruleset with a lot of tweaks and changes, a truly custom Asheron's Call experience.
